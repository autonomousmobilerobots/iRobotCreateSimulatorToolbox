Description:
The iRobot Create Simulator Toolbox is a set of MATLAB files to be used for 
simulating and displaying the movement of the Create robot.  It is designed 
to be used with autonomous control programs that will execute on the Create 
using the MATLAB Toolbox for the iRobot Create (see the User Guide for more 
information).  The toolbox contains GUIs for setting up the environment and 
replaying previous sessions, as well as showing the Create's movement under 
both autonomous and manual control.

Documentation:
The User Guide and new Function Specification documents are included in the 
toolbox. You can download additional documents from the SourceForge page as 
necessary to help with modifying or further understanding the simulator.

Release Quality:
Working release, all functions tested and debugged. The simulator has moved 
past the beta testing stage and is ready for mass use.

ChangeLog:
Bugfix - Changed ReadSonar to actually read all sonar when given the second 
         input argument, instead of just reading the right sonar.
